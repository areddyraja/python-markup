description: After 4 years of Computer Engineering studies at the University of Toronto, I take a look back at what I have learned over the years.

I now sit here, one month away from bringing this chapter of my life to a close - and it feels like it was just yesterday (clich√©, I know...feels probably closer to 2 years ago) that I was writing a short post on my old blog detailing how excited I was to be starting [Engineering Science](http://www.engsci.utoronto.ca/) at U of T.

A lot has changed in 4 years. In summary:

* I am now 4 years older and wiser (and better looking?)
* I have an Iron ring on my pinky (woohooooo!)
* My bank account is less $42,864 in tuition, not including living expenses
* I have met some incredible people with whom I will be friends for life
* I have discovered what makes my system clock tick (with a little flip-flopping along the way)

### The Beginning

I came into U of T (choosing this school over Queens and Waterloo at the time) largely because of the prestigious Engineering Science program and the Aerospace option that it offered. I grew up fascinated by aircraft, and I certainly do love flying them, so why not design them? By the time first year had come to an end, and I had experienced courses in everything from pointers to Plasma Membrane (for the record, I had to Google a cell part beginning with P). 

First year was like a sampler platter, and one thing stood out in my mind in particular: I got more thrill from writing programs to solve problems than I did from any other subject. I switched into [ECE](http://www.ece.utoronto.ca/) at the end of the year.

### The ECE Years
I told myself that by switching to ECE, I would be doing away with the boring and uninteresting topics of the previous year. I was remotivated, and ready to kick ass in a new program. The ass kicking came through in a spectacular fashion - unfortunately I was on the receiving end. I pushed through the courses that I found uninteresting (EM fields, Calculus, and Analog Electronics), telling myself that it would all be worth it for the good stuff (Computer Hardware, Software Design Project, and Software Design). For 3rd and 4th year, I would even get to choose my own schedule, picking just the courses that I was interested in.

3rd Year rolled around, and told myself I would be doing away with the boring and uninteresting topics of the previous year. I pushed through the courses that I found uninteresting (Probability, Engineering Economics, and Control Systems), telling myself that it would all be worth it for the good stuff (Operating Systems, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Database Design).

Starting to sound a bit repetitive? It feels repetitive.

*Spoiler alert: 4th year has been no different.*

### Retrospective
Looking back on it, about 20% of the courses that I have taken while at University have been relevant to my interests. In order to be certified as a *well rounded* engineering graduate, the other 80% of courses are required for breadth. I don't hold this as a fault with the program itself, but rather as an outlook of where my own experience fell short of what it possibly could have.

I have been motivating myself to continue with the false promise to myself that it would eventually get better. In the end, it has ultimately been my own personal ventures outside the classroom that have landed me all of my big opportunities:

1. Building online web projects in my spare time
2. Learning how to create a slick looking resume and web portfolio to quickly let people learn who I am, and what I am about
3. Joining the [You're Next Career Network](http://yourenext.ca/), and getting to learn from some other incredible students

But most importantly: **Pursuing my true passions of writing software and flying in every spare moment of my time**

If only to let me discover myself, being in University has been a worthwhile and fulfilling experience. It has taught me how to work hard and persevere. I have learned how to sell myself. It has been an expensive process in self-discovery that has shaped me immeasurably as a person, and despite sometimes feeling like a *slave* to the syllabus of seemingly useless courses, I have in fact come out of University stronger and more determined to follow my passions than ever before.

### The Cycle Breaks Here
In June of this year, I will begin on the next major quest in my life by starting training to become a Commercial Airline Pilot with British Airways.

At this point, I can say with full confidence that my future will consist of a blending of my two passions. I am looking forward to my ground school studies as part of my upcoming flying course because I know that I find the subject intrinsically interesting. I know that I look forward to learning new programming techniques and building new software in my own time because I have experimentally determined that this is what makes me tick.

The future is full of unknowns, which is exciting because what I do know is that it will be spent tackling problem involving something I love - and I have my time at the University of Toronto Engineering faculty to thank for helping me figure this out.
